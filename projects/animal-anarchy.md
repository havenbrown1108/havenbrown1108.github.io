# Animal Anarchy

## Overview
An educator reached out with an interest in developing a game to educate middle grade students on the impacts of climate change. Students attempt to prevent the extinction of species by moving animals to suitable biomes before climate change catches up with them! Each biome has different environmental challenges including fracking, oil rigs, and wildfires that slowly eat away at the board.

## My Role
I worked collaboratively with the lead programmer to implement this game. We spent two weeks in architectural design focusing on decoupling systems and finding where systems could be reused from project to project. After carefully laying out the project design and milestones, we were able to split tasks in ClickUp and easily keep each other up to date on the state of the project. We also intentionally separated engineering design meetings from all-hands meetings so we could translate features requested by artists and game designers into our technical design.
