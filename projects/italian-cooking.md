# Italian Cooking

## Overview
A faculty member at the department of World Languages, Literatures, and Cultures at University of Arkansas reached out to Causeway Studios to create an immersive language experience for students studying Italian. We created this VR game targeting the Meta Quest 2 using 360 video from a kitchen in Rome!

Students learn to make cacio pepe in Italian. Instructions are written and spoken in Italian step by step. When a student correctly selects the food or utensil necessary for a step, a small confetti display indicates success. When an incorrect action is taken, the background to the instruction text turns red to suggest the student try again. The number of attempts and correct answers are recorded for educators to use in measuring student success.

## My Role
I was the primary developer on this project. I was provided 360 video, 3D assets, and a document detailing the core game loop to implement. 

There were a few challenges in this project that I and my team had to overcome and learn from.

### Using 360 Video
Causeway was provided the 360 video by the stakeholder. It added a sense of realism to the experience. However, in early iterations of the project we found it quickly led to motion sickness. We also felt the transition from the video to the assets we had available was also jarring. To deal with this, we constricted the space the user would be working in to the three by two foot table you see now. We also limited the camera speed significantly to better represent the space. 

### Continuous Development
For this project, we allowed stakeholder and designer feedback throughout the development process. This led to many features being tacked on that were not apart of the intial design and as a result, a lot of development time was spent debugging. To get the project out on time, the programming lead jumped on to sort out some of these bugs. For the next project, Animal Anarchy, we spent more time on a decoupled architecture, raised standards of communication between all stakeholders, and set specific points in the project where we received feedback and allowed new features to be proposed.
